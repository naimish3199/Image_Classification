Initially before running code on google colab we have to make 3 folders manually which will contains train , test and validation data . Train , Test and Validation data is created in the code using "splitfolders" . I have used folders name as "ProcessedData" , "MNSITProcessed" and "P3" for Part 1 , Part 2 and Part 3 respectively .

For Part 1 - https://www.dropbox.com/s/pan6mutc5xj5kj0/trainPart1.zip , 
For Part 2 - MNIST.zip (already uploaded in files section) , 
For Part 3 - https://www.dropbox.com/s/otc12z2w7f7xm8z/mnistTask3.zip

**For Part 2 -  **
Pretrained network can have high convergence time , less final accuracy as compared to randomly initialized network because Pretrained network for part 1 contains large number of classes so learning will be less as compared to MNIST.zip dataset as it has less classes (roughly)
